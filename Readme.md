## Download video/audio from youtube.

This script supports two types of downloads (for more information read this page https://python-pytube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart.html#dash-vs-progressive-streams):
- Progressive (legacy) - supports only 720p
- Adaptive - supports > 720p, but then you have to download both audio and video individually.

Based on https://python-pytube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html

### How to run
